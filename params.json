The aim of this app is to create the\r\nbest Hisnul Muslim app the Play Store has ever seen, in terms of usability and performance.\r\n\r\n# Requirements\r\n1. No Ads. The app should be given to the people free of charge with all features accessible.\r\n2. Must adhere to Google design guidelines in terms of icon design, font use, and to a large extent even app patterns.\r\n3. The Arabic text should be clear with the correct tashkeel/harakaat.\r\n4. The app should have no linguistic mistakes with regard to grammar and syntax for the interface as well as duas.\r\nI'm getting tired of poorly written apps.\r\n\r\n# Constraints\r\n1. App will support platforms 4.1.2 (JellyBean) and upwards. This may change later.\r\n\r\n# (Intended) Features\r\n1. All duas from Hisnul Muslim. I also hope to add verification for the sources in the future. The app should not have duas which\r\nare not present in Hisnul Muslim. This is after all a Hisnul Muslim app.\r\n2. Bookmarking function. Users should be allowed to bookmark a certain dua so that they can easily access it later on. Each\r\nseparate dua should have this feature. So, if there are 2 duas for \"waking up\", then each of them would have the ability to be\r\nbookmarked.\r\n3. Users should be able to \"share\" the dua on social networks (or other apps as well).\r\n4. The app should be optimized for performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Libraries Used\r\n- Android Support Library\r\n- [TextJustify-Android](https://github.com/bluejamesbond/TextJustify-Android)\r\n- [Shamanland Floating Action Bar](https://github.com/shamanland/floating-action-button) (we might end up not using this)\r\n- [Google Material Design Icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons)\r\n\r\n# Credits\r\n- [Azhar Ali](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/md-azhar-ali/90/251/140)\r\n- [Abdul Majed Ahmed](https://www.facebook.com/abdulmajed.ahmed)\r\n- [StackOverFlow Question: Custom Adapter for ListView](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8166497/custom-adapter-for-list-view)\r\n- [StackOverFlow Question: Default Font Set on Android](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6809944/default-font-set-on-android)\r\n- [Font Awesome CSS Library](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)\r\n\r\n# Changelog\r\n- 13th Dec 2014: Added 'About' activity to the app. Added 'Search' widget in DuaList activity menu. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Updated credits in README.\r\n- 7th Dec 2014: Uploaded refactored code.
